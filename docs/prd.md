# 📞 CallOne – Simple App Plan
app url http://localhost:3000/privacy-policy
## 1️⃣ App Goal

CallOne helps users remember to call one family member or friend each week.

The idea is simple:
Pick one person.
Call them once per week.
Stay consistent.

No social network.
No messaging system.
Just a reminder and tracking.

---

## 2️⃣ What The App Does

* User adds one contact (name only)
* Sets preferred call day (e.g., Sunday)
* Gets a weekly reminder
* Marks call as completed
* Tracks weekly streak

Everything stored locally.

---

## 3️⃣ What The App Does NOT Do

* No call recording
* No monitoring call duration
* No accessing contact list automatically (unless user chooses)
* No social features
* No data collection
* No emotional or medical claims

It’s just a reminder + streak tracker.

---

# 4️⃣ Core User Story

> As a user, I choose one person I want to call weekly, receive a reminder on my chosen day, make the call, mark it complete, and keep my weekly streak going.

Simple habit loop.

---

# 5️⃣ App Structure

## 🏠 1. Main Screen

Top:

* This week’s target person:
  “This week: Call Mom”
* Countdown:
  “Next reminder: Sunday”

Center:

* Big button:
  📞 “Call Now”

(If possible, this opens phone dialer.)

Below:

* Button:
  ✅ “Mark as Called”

If already completed:

* Message:
  “Call completed this week.”
* Streak visible

---

## 🔁 2. Streak / History Page

Simple weekly list:

* Week 1 – Completed
* Week 2 – Completed
* Week 3 – Missed

At top:

* Current streak
* Longest streak

No analytics.
No charts.
Just consistency tracking.

---

## ⚙️ 3. Settings Page

* Change contact name
* Change reminder day
* Enable/disable notifications
* Reset streak
* Privacy Policy
* App version

Minimal but complete.

---

# 6️⃣ The One Nice-to-Have Feature

### 💬 Rotating Contact Mode (Optional Toggle)

Instead of one fixed person, user can:

* Add up to 3 people
* App rotates weekly automatically

Example:
Week 1 → Mom
Week 2 → Dad
Week 3 → Best Friend

This keeps it fresh without complexity.

Still very small feature.

---

# 7️⃣ Reminder Logic

* Weekly reminder on selected day
* If user marks as completed → streak +1
* If week passes without completion → streak resets

Simple weekly cycle.

---

# 8️⃣ MVP Scope (3–4 Hour Build Realistic)

### Must Have

* Add one contact name
* Weekly reminder
* Mark complete
* Weekly streak counter
* Local storage

### Nice to Have

* Rotating contact mode

---

# 9️⃣ Play Store Positioning

Use phrases like:

* “Weekly call reminder”
* “Stay connected”
* “Simple reminder to call someone”
* “Build a weekly call habit”

Avoid:

* Loneliness reduction
* Mental health benefits
* Emotional therapy framing
* Relationship improvement claims

Keep it neutral and behavioral.

---

# Why CallOne Is Interesting

Compared to your other ideas:

* More emotional hook
* Less crowded niche
* Unique positioning
* Still extremely simple technically
* Very low policy risk

It feels human, not generic.
