Privacy Policy

Last Updated: January 2026

CallOne ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by the CallOne application.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect or store any personal data on our servers. All your data, including contacts and preferences, is stored locally on your device or securely synced through your respective cloud provider (e.g., Google Drive or iCloud) if enabled.

2. Usage Data
We prioritize your privacy. The app only accesses the internet for essential services such as fetching app configurations and minimal anonymous telemetry required for basic app improvements safely processed via standard analytics, which you can opt out of.

3. Third-Party Services
Our app operates independently and does not sell or share your personal information with any third parties under any circumstances.

4. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@callone.app.
